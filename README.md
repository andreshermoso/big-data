## Professional Experience – Big Data Engineering

In 2015, I signed a contract with Nextech C.A. in Venezuela to support their SAS Institute analytics software solutions portfolio supporting Cloudera Hadoop HDFS Enterprise Data Hub architecture for United Telecommunications Services (UTS) Curaçao.

This was a 36-week-long business intelligence (BI) engagement focused on integrating heterogeneous, multi-platform legacy data sources into unified dashboards covering

1. [Company revenue](#slowtransactions)
 
 
2. [Billing](#resourcecontention)
  
  
3. [Network traffic data](#monitoringandanalysis)


4. [Bandwidth allocation](#tuningdatabaseparameters)


5. [Network quality analysis](#spacemanagement)


6. [Call detail records analysis](#backupandrecovery)




... And many other practical, real-world activities

I’ve also compiled an extensive set of AI-generated prompts that have helped me solve complex AWS DevOps challenges. These experiences have sharpened my prompt engineering skills, which I believe will soon enhance how I structure and version-control this repository using Git more effectively.

Currently, I’m diving into the emerging intersection of AI Agents and DevOps, while continuing to address the ongoing day-to-day challenges of ASE database administration.

This repository is a work in progress. As I continue exploring the latest from ASE, IQ, RS, SQLA, and PowerDesigner, I ask for your patience while I refine and version-control the most useful AI-assisted scripts in the most efficient way possible.
