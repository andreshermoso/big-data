## Professional Experience – Big Data Engineering

In 2015, I signed a contract with Nextech C.A. in Venezuela to support their SAS Institute analytics software solutions portfolio supporting Cloudera Hadoop HDFS Enterprise Data Hub architecture for United Telecommunications Services (UTS) Curaçao.

This was a 36-week-long business intelligence (BI) engagement focused on integrating heterogeneous, multi-platform legacy data sources into unified dashboards covering

1. [Company revenue](#slowtransactions)
 
 
2. [Billing](#resourcecontention)
  
  
3. [Network traffic data](#monitoringandanalysis)


4. [Bandwidth allocation](#tuningdatabaseparameters)


5. [Network quality analysis](#spacemanagement)


6. [Call detail records analysis](#backupandrecovery)


The project supported SAS Visual Analytics, SAS/ACCESS Interface to Hadoop, and SAS Data Loader for Hadoop, running on an HP ProLiant 4-node cluster with 8 cores and 27.49 TB of storage.

After the implementation, I gained a new perspective on the complexity and challenges posed by rapidly growing, large-scale data sets. Until then, my experience had primarily focused on structured data management using tools like Informatica PowerCenter (ETL) and the SAP data management portfolio.

This project exposed me to the reality of managing structured and unstructured data sources as a single unified environment, including massive datasets generated by social media, which contain valuable insights for telecommunications companies—especially when telcos can filter user-generated social data in real time.

The experience also introduced me to the ethical implications and ongoing debates surrounding data privacy, particularly the role of telecommunications companies in handling user data. It raised important questions about how to define boundaries for responsible data usage when analyzing customer information for business intelligence purposes.

My work with Hadoop-based data querying sparked a strong interest in developing data science skills, especially at a time when AI had not yet become a dominant part of the conversation.
